# Calc-II-Taylor-Series
The purpose of this Notebook is to explain pointwise convergence of the Taylor series. This idea is discussed from the perspective of convergence of the polynomial and convergence of the remainder. This Notebook also discussed Taylor's Remainder Theorem and how it is used in practice to determine whether or not a Taylor series converges to the function it is trying to approximate.
